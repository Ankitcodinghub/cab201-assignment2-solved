User Interface

The&nbsp;<em>Arriba Eats</em>&nbsp;company has plans to eventually develop a graphical user interface for this application; however, the prototype implementation will have a simple text-based interface. To make it easier to switch to a graphical user interface in the future, we want to ensure the user interface code is kept separate from the application logic.

The detailed specification for this application‚Äôs user interface is available here:&nbsp;<a href="https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/20346/pages/cab201-oo-assignment-interface-specification">CAB201 OO Assignment ‚Äì Interface Specification</a>

&nbsp;

Database

The&nbsp;<em>Arriba Eats</em>&nbsp;company plans to eventually use a relational database to store and save all customer data. However, for this prototype, all data will be kept in memory (and will therefore be lost when the application is shut down).

&nbsp;

Recommended Approach

You are encouraged to design and develop the application using an&nbsp;<u>iterative and incremental approach</u>&nbsp;‚Äî implementing one user story at a time. You can implement the user stories in any order you choose; however, for each new user story, you should design and implement only the classes and methods required to implement that user story.

The following points need to be emphasised.

<ol>
<li>In general, the user stories are designed to become more complex as you progress down the list. However, some user stores relay on others to be implemented</li>
<li>When registering a user, only the customer‚Äôs input for the shared data (name, age, email address, mobile number, and password) will be tested. It is recommended that you start by registering a customer rather than the other types of users. The other user type specific data will be tested when the other types are registered.</li>
<li>You have to submit your code to Gradescope. So, you have to make sure that your output matches Gradescope‚Äôs output perfectly. There is also, a video on Canvas that provide an example of the application and demonstrates how to achieve some of the user stories.</li>
<li>The interaction is menu based that ultimately uses the standard input and output statements. As you progress you do have to implement every menu option, only to display those options to the screen. This will allow you to ‚Äòfast track‚Äô throughout your testing.</li>
</ol>
When producing your solution, you may need to first&nbsp;<em>refactor</em>&nbsp;some of the classes and methods that you have already implemented for earlier user stories to better facilitate the new user story. After each user story, you should have working code that achieves all of the user stories considered so far.

<strong>If your submitted code does not compile, then you will receive 0 marks for functionality.</strong>

Test Cases

<a href="https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/20346/files/5916626?wrap=1">Assignment 2 ‚Äì Inputs and Outputs.zip</a><a href="https://canvas.qut.edu.au/courses/20346/files/5916626/download?download_frd=1">Download Assignment 2 ‚Äì Inputs and Outputs.zip</a>

We have provided a set of input and output text files that you can use to develop your assignment. These files are exact duplicates of the Gradescope test cases. &nbsp;The input files capture your typed input, such as menu responses and names. The output files record the results that would typically be displayed on the screen.

This will enable you to test each case individually, rather than going through Gradescope every time. However, one you have implemented each test successfully, we recommend resubmitting to Gradescope to make sure that your submission does not introduce errors to cases that you have previously passed.

There are two ways you can use these files.

<ul>
<li>You can open up the contents of one of the ‚ÄòInputs‚Äô files in a text editor, copy the contents of the file and then paste it into your program. You can then scroll up and read the output of the program, comparing it with the respective ‚ÄòRefOutputs‚Äô file to see when errors crop up.</li>
<li>You can also supply your inputs to your assignment‚Äôs executable using input redirection. This will also allow you to redirect the output for easier comparisons (e.g. using a tool like&nbsp;<a href="https://winmerge.org/">WinMergeLinks to an external site.</a>). You can use redirection with the less-than symbol (&lt;) following this template:</li>
</ul>
executable &lt; directory/inputfile

or if you are using Powershell use:

Get-Content directory/inputfile | executable

Where:

<ul>
<li><strong>Directory</strong>is the folder containing your executable.</li>
<li><strong>Executable</strong>is the name of the executable (.exe), usually the same name as your project. For Visual Studio 2022 users, this will likely be in the ‚Äúbin\Debug\net8.0‚Äù directory of your source code (note: this may vary depending on your version of .NET).</li>
<li><strong>Inputfile</strong>is the input file name.</li>
</ul>
On Windows using Visual Studio 2022, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Click the magnifying glass icon in Windows and type ‚ÄòCommand Prompt.‚Äô Then, click on the Command Prompt application.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory of your executable. For Visual Studio 2022 projects, this is typically in something like your project‚Äôs ‚Äúbin\Debug\net8.0‚Äù directory (the specific version of .NET may differ,</li>
</ol>
C:\cd ‚ÄúC:\CAB201\ArribaEats\bin\Debug\net8.0‚Äù

C:\CAB201\ArribaEats\bin\Debug\net8.0&gt;

<ol>
<li>Download the Assignment 2 ‚Äì Inputs and Outputs.zip file, copy it to your executable‚Äôs directory, and unzip it. The ‚ÄòInputs‚Äô folder should contain all the input text files. Depending on your unzipping tool, the files may extract into an extra subdirectory, so be sure to move them into a direct subfolder of your executable.</li>
<li>To execute the program using an input file, use&nbsp;executable &lt; inputfile. For example, if your executable is named ArribaEats, you would run&nbsp;ArribaEats &lt; ‚ÄúInputs\01. Startup Menu.txt‚Äùto execute the first case study.</li>
</ol>
C:\cab201\ArribaEats\bin\Debug\net8.0&gt;ArribaEats &lt; ‚ÄúInputs\01. Startup Menu.txt‚Äù

Welcome to Arriba Eats!

Please make a choice from the menu below:

1: Login as a registered user

2: Register as a new user

3: Exit

Please enter a choice between 1 and 3:

Thank you for using Arriba Eats!

C:\cab201\ArribaEats\bin\Debug\net8.0&gt;

Your screen will display the output. You can compare this output with the corresponding Gradescope output either by manually inspecting the corresponding file in the RefOutputs folder, or by redirecting the output of your program into a file and then using the&nbsp;fc&nbsp;command:

C:\cab201\ArribaEats\bin\Debug\net8.0&gt;ArribaEats &lt; ‚ÄúInputs\01. Startup Menu.txt‚Äù &gt; MyOutput.txt

C:\cab201\ArribaEats\bin\Debug\net8.0&gt;fc ‚ÄúRefOutputs\01. Startup Menu.txt‚Äù MyOutput.txt

Comparing files REFOUTPUTS\01. Startup Menu.txt and MYOUTPUT.TXT

FC: no differences encountered

Remember, anytime you enter invalid input, the program will loop until valid data is provided. This could potentially lead to an infinite loop if your implementation handles errors incorrectly.

Test Cases Code Quality

While it is possible to write poor quality code that passes all of the autograder tests, it is also important to write high-quality code. Below is a non-exhaustive list of how each test can help improve your code quality. Please note that this list will&nbsp;<em>help</em>&nbsp;you write better code, but you will still need to apply other code quality techniques discussed during the semester to achieve a high mark (e.g. object-oriented class design, visibility, SOLID design) .

Code Smells

<strong>Code smells</strong>&nbsp;are issues that indicate poor code quality. While the code may be functional and pass Gradescope tests, you may be marked down when your code quality is assessed. Note that the list is diverse: some smells can be fixed after your first attempt at writing code, but others should be avoided from the start. Some are simple issues, while others are more serious. Refactoring is a good way of addressing them (<a href="https://refactoring.guru/refactoring">https://refactoring.guru/refactoringLinks to an external site.</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://refactoring.com/">https://refactoring.com/Links to an external site.</a>).

<ul>
<li>Inappropriate identifiers.</li>
<li>Fields not segmented into classes correctly.</li>
<li>Too many fields clumped together (an indication that they should form a separate class).</li>
<li>Overusing basic types instead of objects.</li>
<li>Not using types correctly (e.g. Enums, Booleans, etc.).</li>
<li>Not using constants correctly.</li>
<li>Using a constant or literal for the length of a collection rather than calling the length method.</li>
<li>Methods not segmented into classes correctly.</li>
<li>Duplicate code (which probably should be moved into a method).</li>
<li>Inappropriate visibility for fields, methods, or properties.</li>
<li>Inappropriate use of getters and setters.</li>
<li>Methods directly interact with data in other classes.</li>
<li>A small change requires changes in many places.</li>
<li>Excessive use of switch/if statements instead of using inheritance or polymorphism.</li>
<li>A ‚ÄúGod‚Äù object that does too much and has responsibilities that should belong to other classes.</li>
<li>Inappropriate global fields or classes (usually via the keyword static).</li>
<li>Too many responsibilities in a class.</li>
<li>Too many responsibilities in an interface.</li>
<li>Structs used inappropriately instead of classes (i.e. classes without methods).</li>
<li>Too few responsibilities in classes.</li>
<li>Use of magic numbers or values.</li>
<li>Methods not segmented correctly within a class (e.g. one large method instead of several smaller ones).</li>
<li>Code repetition.</li>
<li>Errors in input handling are not placed inside a loop but instead handled with a ‚Äúbackup‚Äù statement (i.e. if it fails the first time, it gets the correct input the second time but does not handle multiple incorrect inputs).</li>
<li>Incorrect use of static fields in an interface that is then implemented by a class (these should be placed in a parent class instead).</li>
<li>Inappropriate use of an abstract class.</li>
<li>Interfaces are not used correctly.</li>
<li>Subclasses are not used correctly.</li>
<li>Data in classes is not kept up to date.</li>
<li>Data classes directly interact with the user interface (which they shouldn‚Äôt).</li>
<li>Managing a collection of objects is placed within the individual object.</li>
<li>Methods are tightly coupled via&nbsp;<em>control coupling</em>, where special parameter values are used to control internal operations.</li>
<li>Classes are coupled via&nbsp;<em>stamp coupling</em>, where a complex data object is passed as a parameter but only part of it is used in each class.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gradescope Smells</strong>

<ul>
<li>Using Write instead of WriteLine can result in messy or unclear output.</li>
<li>Be careful of trailing spaces when printing to the screen, as text will look the same but will be interpreted differently by Gradescope.</li>
</ul>

Marking Criteria

There are of&nbsp;<strong>50 marks</strong>&nbsp;available for this assessment item. Your submission will be marked with a mix of automated and manual processes.

<strong>Autograder: 20 marks</strong>

When you submit your code to Gradescope, it will be automatically run against a battery of test cases, checking many different combinations of customers, restaurants, restaurant items, delivery drivers and orders, testing different paths through your program. These have been designed to vary in complexity, ensuring that you can pass some test cases even with a very early implementation. For this reason, it is recommended that you submit to Gradescope&nbsp;<strong>early and often</strong>, to ensure that your code is successfully compiling and running on our grading platform.

Each test case has the same structure, where you will be presented with a menu and you have to enter input to navigate it.

There are also a handful of test cases that purposefully provide invalid input. Your program will receive full marks for that test case if it behaves correctly in that situation, and no marks otherwise.

It is important that your program produces the same expected output as Gradescope. Variations in the output formatting (i.e. the messages your program prints out) may cause Gradescope to misinterpret your input and cause you to fail test cases that you would have otherwise passed.

Make sure you use Console.ReadLine() for reading all text ‚Äì other Console functions for reading keys may not work with Gradescope, even though they might seem to be fine when run on your machine. Every input is on a line by itself and terminated by pressing the enter key, and that goes for selecting options from the menu as well as text and numeric inputs.

One last note: While we do not vary the test cases from run to run, if we discover during manual inspection of your program that you have hard-coded in our test cases and results (that is, instead of implementing the restaurant ordering and delivery logic, you have built your program to specifically recognise our test cases and produce the output we expect) you will receive a score of 0 for functionality, and likely a poor score from the object-oriented design and implementation, since it will not be considered useful work.

<strong>Abstraction: 7 marks</strong>

Your use of abstraction is marked by analysing your source code. Under this criterion, the following will be penalised:

<ul>
<li>Overly long or complex methods that should be broken up into simpler methods</li>
<li>Repetitive coding constructs that should be a loop instead</li>
<li>Sections of code or methods that are overly similar to other sections of code/methods and should be abstracted out into a common method</li>
<li>Use of magic numbers in your code (these should be replaced by declaring a const field with a descriptive name containing the value)</li>
</ul>
In general, we are looking for anything other than code clarity and your OOP design (as those are marked in their own criteria) that makes your code more difficult to maintain.

<strong>Object-oriented design and implementation: 10 marks</strong>

Your object-oriented design and implementation will be checked by looking at your class inheritance hierarchy and examining source code to check your use of polymorphism and encapsulation, as well as the private/protected/internal/public state of your methods, fields and properties.

<strong>Coupling and cohesion: 8 marks</strong>

Your coupling and cohesion will be checked by examining class interdependencies and looking at the methods/fields/properties present in each class.

As a refresher,&nbsp;<strong>coupling</strong>&nbsp;is something you are trying to minimise (it means unhealthy dependencies between classes that make your code less reusable), while&nbsp;<strong>cohesion</strong>&nbsp;is something you are trying to maximise (it means each class is responsible for a single unified task and all methods/fields/properties support that task).

<strong>Code clarity and comments: 5 marks</strong>

Code clarity is marked by looking at how your choice of identifiers (names of classes, methods, properties, fields, local variables) and your program‚Äôs flow (use of loops / branching) affects the comprehensibility and maintainability of your code. For comments, we are looking for two different kinds: top-level XML tag comments (///) and body-level comments (usually single-line // comments).
